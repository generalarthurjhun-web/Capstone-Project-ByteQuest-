## Completed implementation

### Simulation platform

- [x] Responsive reusable 2D scene engine with pan/zoom/reset, landscape support, scene-coordinate scaling, hotspots, connection painter, and object-list alternative.
- [x] Hotspot states: neutral, selected, completed, and error; minimum 48 × 48 dp targets and semantics.
- [x] Tool tray with compatibility checks and structured evidence.
- [x] Fourteen reusable interaction families: inspect, multi-select, tool, connect, configure, sequence, match, controlled placement, troubleshoot, test run, observe, decide, interpret, and evidence review.
- [x] State-driven connection, device, placement, test, and completion transitions with reduced-motion support.
- [x] Explicit review/return/confirm flow with terminal submission latch and pending-evidence retry.

### Twenty-mission catalog

- [x] COC1 M1–M5.
- [x] COC2 M1–M5; protected cable evaluator route retained.
- [x] COC3 M1–M5.
- [x] COC4 M1–M5.
- [x] Exactly 20 stable IDs (`coc1_m1` through `coc4_m5`).
- [x] 116/116 catalog phases render without `TechnicalUnavailableState`.
- [x] Every mission resolves to 2–4 actual rendered interaction families, a real technical decision, and observation/test/verification.
- [x] No mission is drag-drop-only.
- [x] Progressive troubleshooting facts, correction gates, stable retest IDs, and source-linked interpretation are enforced.

### Evidence, persistence, and authority

- [x] Immutable structured evidence actions with stable client IDs and serialized dispatch.
- [x] Assigned assessments retain the authoritative attempt-action gateway.
- [x] Standalone practice evidence uses learner-owned `practice_mission_actions`, active-learner RLS, ownership checks, append-only grants, and idempotent action keys.
- [x] Runtime restore rebuilds state from ordered acknowledged server actions, merges/de-duplicates pending local actions, and preserves local presentation preferences offline.
- [x] Practice and assessment storage are isolated by mode and assessment attempt ID.
- [x] Unknown restored phases fail closed; rejected placements never render success.
- [x] Test start and terminal completion use distinct evidence types; configured evaluator actions occur only on terminal events.
- [x] Supabase/PostgreSQL remains the evaluation authority. Flutter does not calculate score/pass/reward/release, and instructor release remains mandatory.

### Accessibility and quality

- [x] Tap alternatives for drag/connection interactions.
- [x] Semantics and 48 dp minimum targets across enabled interaction states.
- [x] Compact, landscape, 2× text, and reduced-motion widget matrices.
- [x] ByteQuest navy/blue tokens and 150–250 ms state transitions.
- [x] Four showcase candidates: COC1 M3, COC2 M3, COC3 M4, COC4 M5.

## Verification results

Fresh integrated `Dro-branch` evidence:

```text
flutter test                     PASS — 189/189
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos PASS — 0 errors, 0 warnings, 213 infos
flutter build apk --debug        PASS
catalog phase render gate        PASS — 116/116, 0 unavailable
focused final acceptance gate    PASS — 100/100
static SQL/lifecycle sentinels   PASS — 8/8
whole-branch review              PASS — no Critical/High/Medium findings
```

APK location (ignored): `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`; integrated size 195,186,392 bytes; SHA-256 `CE1663F11351B08461719AC4AA9284C251B0DF5346C320618B95A77D9F985410`.

## Durable evidence

- `docs/BYTEQUEST_20_MISSION_SCORECARD.md` — provisional mission-level scores and evidence limits.
- `docs/BYTEQUEST_EMULATOR_QA.md` — Android 16 device metadata and shell/lifecycle QA.
- `docs/BYTEQUEST_SIMULATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` — implementation coverage and external blockers.
- `docs/BYTEQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURES.md` — timestamped failed operations, causes, fixes, and alternatives.
- `docs/BYTEQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURE_INDEX.md` — anchored index of every failure entry.
- `supabase/migrations/20260822124500_practice_mission_evidence.sql` — practice evidence schema/RLS migration.

## External checks still unverified

- Authenticated execution of all 20 missions on the emulator. The APK reached onboarding/login and passed portrait, landscape, 2× text, reduced-motion, background/resume, and force-stop/relaunch checks, but no authorized disposable learner credentials were available.
- `pnpm test:all-missions` and `pnpm test:realtime`. The gitignored dashboard `.env.local` and `BYTEQUEST_E2E_PASSWORD` were unavailable, so both stopped before contacting Supabase.
- Live application of the new migration and rollback lifecycle SQL. Static security/lifecycle assertions pass, but no prepared local/live database connection was authorized.

Do not weaken authentication, RLS, backend evaluation, or instructor-release controls to bypass these evidence gaps. Close them in an authorized test environment with disposable learner/instructor credentials and protected secrets.

## Known non-blocking maintenance

- Analyzer informational notices remain, primarily `prefer_const_constructors`, deprecated `.withOpacity`, and existing async-context notices.
- Android build warns that Kotlin 2.2.20 and legacy Kotlin Gradle Plugin application will require future migration; `shared_preferences_android` also applies KGP.
- Android SDK XML tooling versions are mismatched but do not block the current debug build.
- Code-drawn schematic scenes are approved placeholders; replace them with production art later without changing scene/evidence contracts.

## Git handoff

- Reviewed feature commits were transplanted locally onto `Dro-branch`; duplicate rename commit `7878107` was intentionally skipped because `Dro-branch` already contained the canonical `ByteQuest-Mobile-App` rename.
- `main` was not modified.
- Nothing was pushed.
- The feature branch/worktree is preserved for audit and must not be deleted without explicit authorization.
